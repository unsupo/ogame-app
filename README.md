# ogame-app

This is the user interface for the ogame bot being developed in my [ogame repo](https://github.com/unsupo/ogame)

I plan to use ionic to allow this to be turned into a website/PWA(progressive web app)/or android/ios app

This is just the user interface to control the ogame bot and call specific api's.

This should pull a bot program from my repository (ensuring the latest release) if one is not found or address linked to one.

I expect an automated build of an application, this will be what most people will use unless you like command line programs or are working on the development of the bot.

Once created this shouldn't need to change much

I plan to have this help in a number of user related tasks including:
- setting up a new account (or many automated account creation)
- managing one or more accounts
- displaying current activity from the bot(s)
- allowing queuing and scheduling of buildings/research/ships
- allowing automation of farming of inactive and active players
- automation of building creation (ie give task of new account to create deathstar and it'll attempt to meet all prerequites)
- notifications to email, pop-up, ect of events
- fleet/resource saving
- orchestrating multiple bots (either concurrent or distributed bots)
